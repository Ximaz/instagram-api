# Instagram API

This project is an Instagram API guest-oriented, meaning you can perform actions of data collection without having to register. However, you may be facing some Ratelimits, so I recommend you to put some delay between operations.

## Documentation

```python
# from src.api import API

class API:
    """
    The API class provides the necessary data to perform Instagram API web requests.

    To prevent flooding Instagram requests for the same target API, you can use the
    `export_api` function to create an API cache.

    You can also load a previous API cache using the 'load_from' constructor parameter.
